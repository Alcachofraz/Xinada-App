# Xinada App

## Mini-Game

This app will manage rounds of Xinada. Xinada is a Murder Mystery based game, but with many more roles, characters and abilities! This app assumes the game is being played in real life.
Of course, not with actual knifes and pistols! No one needs to get hurt! We normally use sock balls as pistols and pens as knifes.


## How to use?

First of all, you'll need to configure the game. This is the main page:

In the gear icon you can access the settings menu, where 1 of 6 idioms can be selected. In that menu you can also set the role pool for the game, i.e. which roles can be drawn.

After you select the number of rounds and the number of players, you'll have to enter every player's name.

There's a progress bar indicating how many players are left to enter their name.
