# Xinada App

## Mini-Game

This app will manage rounds of Xinada. Xinada is a Murder Mystery based game, but with many more roles, characters and abilities! This app assumes the game is being played in real life.
Of course, not with actual knifes and pistols! No one needs to get hurt! We normally use sock balls as pistols and pens as knifes.


## How to use?

First of all, you'll need to configure the game. This is the main page:

In the gear icon you can access the settings menu, where 1 of 6 idioms can be selected. In that menu you can also set the role pool for the game, i.e. which roles can be drawn.

After you select the number of rounds and the number of players, you'll have to enter every player's name.

There's a progress bar indicating how many players are left to enter their name.

The game is about to start. In this page you see the players' current points. Click "start round 1" to start:

Now, the player with their name on screen should grab the phone alone and click "show" to reveal their role.

The role should appear. Now click "next" to see which player is next. Give them the phone. Keep going like this until all players have their role.

Now you should see a "reveal" button. You'll leave the phone on this page while you play the game. When it ends, come back and reveal the roles.

This is the scoring page. Select the players who won this round.

Then we get back to this page with the players' points. In this case, it was a 1 round game, so the options are "play again" or "finish". If there were more rounds to be played, the "play again" button would be replaced by a "start round x" button.

In every page of the app, you have two buttons in the upper right corner. And info button and a piano button. The piano button toggles the music. The info button will display all roles, and what their objectives are.
